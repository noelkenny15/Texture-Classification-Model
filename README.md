# Texture Classification Model

A Python-based deep learning project for classifying texture images using the **ResNeXt-101** convolutional neural network architecture. The model is trained to classify texture patterns efficiently and is paired with a **Gradio** web interface for interactive testing.

## üß† Model

This project uses **ResNeXt-101**, a powerful deep convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of ResNet and grouped convolutions to provide high accuracy with efficient computation. It‚Äôs pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for texture classification using a custom dataset.

## üìÅ Project Structure
- `main.py`: Loads the dataset, builds, trains, and evaluates the ResNeXt101 model.
- `gradio/app.py`: Provides a Gradio UI for testing the trained model.
- `LICENSE`: Apache 2.0 License.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## üöÄ Features
- Texture classification using transfer learning with ResNeXt101.
- Real-time image prediction through an intuitive Gradio interface.
- Modular, easy-to-understand codebase.
